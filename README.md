**numwords** is a utility package for Go (golang) that converts natural language numbers
to their actual numeric values. The numbers can be parsed out as strings,
integers, or floats as desired.

```go
func Example() {
  s := "I've got three apples and two and a half bananas"
  fmt.Println(ParseString(s))

  s = "My chili won second place at the county fair"
  fmt.Println(ParseString(s))

  i, _ := ParseInt("fourteen ninety two")
  fmt.Println(i)

  f, _ := ParseFloat("eight and three quarters")
  fmt.Println(f)

  // Output:
  // I've got 3 apples and 2.5 bananas
  // My chili won 2nd place at the county fair
  // 1492
  // 8.75
}
```

This package is largely inspired by the excellent [Numerizer Ruby gem](https://github.com/jduff/numerizer).
